I had the privilege of knowing Johnnie and Lisa for 35 years. He was 
a joy to be with and he and Lisa were a couple that were made for each 
other and all those who respected and loved them both. I will miss 
Johnnie but I know that he is now playing lead with the orchestra of 
the Heavens. It still, however leaves a hole in my heart. Lisa was a 
great partner and a wonderful wife and accompaniest in the music of 
life.

There will never be a better pair of musicians, loves and above all, best friends.
