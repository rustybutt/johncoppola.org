I first heard John in 1969 when he came to play a Gary Olds 
piece for jazz quartet and orchestra when I was at Lowell High. 
We trumpet players had NEVER heard anything like that. His 
sound was more than loud, it was huge, rich, vibrant and 
filled our 1000 seat auditorium. We were all blown away.
<p>
I later studied with John while in college. Lessons often 
included a glass of red wine. He had all these cats (the 
feline kind) with cool names like Ace, Max, Burt, Rhoda, 
and he had a dog named Good Dog, who would sit in the room 
with us while we played and he'd sing along with us.
<p>
John spent a lot of time teaching and mentoring young 
players. He was always concerned about helping young players 
make better music. Classical teachers were always concerned 
about technique and playing every note just so. Many times I 
saw John take a phrase and help a young player simplify the 
lick in such a way that made it easier to play and thus swing 
so much better. The love of swing was at the very heart of 
who he was this whole lifetime. There are many, many trumpet 
players, and former players, who learned the love of swing from John.
<p>
John worked with a who's who of big band swing and show biz. 
In his day he was a major rock star. In 1950, John was playing 
lead trumpet with the Charlie Barnet band at the Apollo Theatre 
in Harlem. In 1950, if you were playing at the Apollo and you 
were white, you'd better be amazing because that crowd wouldn't 
accept or respect anything less than that. John was more 
than amazing.
<p>
But playing trumpet wasn't his only amazing gift. John was also 
incredible in the kitchen. Dinner at John's house was always 
something to remember, even if Ace did have the run of the kitchen 
counter. I remember seeing Ace reach into John's Calphalon frying 
pan and hook a piece of sausage with a claw.
<p>
For me there was never anyone more wonderful and inspiring than John 
Coppola. But now it's our turn to pass on that love of music and 
swing to another generation. As the song says, "It don't mean a 
thing if it ain't got that swing!
