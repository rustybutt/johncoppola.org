I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting John Coppola through Lisa Pollard 
and was honored that he took part in our radio "special" of "Jazz on the Streets", 
as part of our series "Jazz on the Bay" for RTE Radio 1 (Ireland's National 
Broadcasting station). I will remember not only his incredible musicianship 
and beautiful tone on the trumpet, but also his terrific sense of humor. Our 
more recent get-togethers and delicious dinners with Lisa and John at their 
home were unforgettable events full of warmth, generosity, laughter, song, 
music.

Everything that is of value in our world. Lisa has been an incredible loving 
support to John, especially towards the end and my heart goes out to her and 
all those close to John.
